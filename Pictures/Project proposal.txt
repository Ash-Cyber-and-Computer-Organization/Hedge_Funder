PROJECT OVERVIEW
This platform is a multi-component automated trading and supervision system that connects admins, customers, AI trading algorithms, and brokers (MT5, Binance, etc.) through a unified web interface.
Goals
"The goal of Hedge_Funder is to design and deploy a secure, scalable, and automated AI-driven financial trading ecosystem that integrates market data ingestion, real-time analysis, predictive modeling, and trade execution through n8n workflows, with seamless CI/CD pipelines, containerized microservices, and cloud-native infrastructure, ensuring low-latency performance, transparency, compliance, monitoring, and actionable insights for optimized trading decisions and sustained business growth."

Documentation
Frontend
* Public Pages: Login, Signup, Landing Page.

* Admin Dashboard:

   * Add/manage accounts (via MT5/Binance API).

   * Monitor open positions, balances, P&L (profit/loss).

   * Supervise accounts, disable/stop trades.

   * Send signals manually to linked accounts.

   * View live charts.

      * Customer Dashboard:

         * OAuth login → linked to their trading account.

         * See ongoing trades, trade history, profits/losses, progress.

Backend
The backend has three main stages:
            1. Trading Algorithms (3 types)

               * Signal Parsing Algorithm → reads signals from Telegram groups, parses them, and sends incomplete ones to AI for completion.

               * Market Analysis Algorithm → fetches financial data (e.g., yfinance, Finnhub), analyzes, and places trades instantly using an AI agent (like n8n).

               * News & Social Sentiment Algorithm → scrapes Reddit/Twitter, analyzes trends/news, and places trades.

                  2. AI Integration

                     * Fills incomplete signals.

                     * Optimizes trades with precise stop-loss (<10% error) and maximum take-profit values.

                     * Chooses between short-term scalps or long-range trades.

                     * Continuously improves accuracy by learning from results.

                        3. Execution & Notifications

                           * Executed trades are sent to broker platforms (MT5/Binance).

                           * Every placed/closed trade triggers alerts via Telegram Bot + WhatsApp Bot.

                           * Execution is funneled through ngrok endpoints for secure API calls.

Infrastructure
                              * Hosting: Linux EC2 server (AWS).

                              * Trade Execution Environment: MT5 running via Wine.

                              * Caching: Redis / Dragonfly → optimize real-time trade data and prevent API overload.

                              * Database: Supabase → store trades, profits/losses, login data, history.

                              * CI/CD: GitHub Actions → automated testing, build, and deployment.

                              * Bots: Telegram & WhatsApp bots for admin/customer notifications.
